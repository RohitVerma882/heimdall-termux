heimdall on linux
====================

Usage:
---------

1. Fully charge your phone (use the wall charger as it's faster).

2. Download a decrypted device ROM or a Heimdall Firmware Package and extract everything to the one directory.

3. If the ROM is not a Heimdall Firmware Package it may instead be provided as multiple archives (nested or otherwise), extract them all to the same location.
   NOTE: If you want to use the CSC then extract it last.
   
4. Put your Galaxy S device into download mode and plug it in..

5. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the ROM/firmware files.

6. Type the following to list all the functionality Heimdall supports:
   
   heimdall help
   

7. Before flashing, you must first know the names of the partitions you wish to flash. These can be obtained by executing:
   
   heimdall print-pit --no-reboot
   
   The inclusion of --no-reboot ensures the phone will not reboot after PIT file has been downloaded and displayed. 
   After executing a command with the --no-reboot argument, the next command should include the --resume argument.
   NOTE: You can still safely reboot your phone manually (with the power button) after executing --no-reboot commands.

8. Use the help and print-pit output to construct a command with all the files you want to flash.
   Here is an example that does a full flash and repartition on a GT-I9000:
   
   heimdall flash --repartition --resume --pit s1_odin_20100512.pit --FACTORYFS factoryfs.rfs --CACHE cache.rfs --DBDATA dbdata.rfs --IBL+PBL boot.bin --SBL Sbl.bin --PARAM param.lfs --KERNEL zImage --MODEM modem.bin
   

9. Heimdall will display the progress as it flashes so that you know things are working as they should.
